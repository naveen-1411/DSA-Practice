// This is a Java program
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, Java!");
    }
}

\*
Explanation:
public class HelloWorld: You're defining a class called HelloWorld. This is like creating a container.

public static void main(String[] args): This is the main method — it’s where your program starts running.

System.out.println(...): This prints something to the screen.
