Weâ€™ll do 3 things:

1. Learn the Java syntax slowly and clearly

2. Build your first array code from scratch, step-by-step

3. Understand how and why each piece of code works

->What is Java?
Java is a language that tells your computer what to do.

A Java program has:

* A class: Like a blueprint

* A method: The set of steps you want to run

* A main() method: The starting point of any Java program

Basic Java Code Structure is mentioned in hello world file

Step 2: Learn What Arrays Are (With Real Meaning)
 What is an array?
Imagine a box with multiple compartments.

You can store numbers in it: like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

You can access them by position (called index). note index start from 0 
 see file array to know more about it.
